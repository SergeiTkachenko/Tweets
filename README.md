# Tweets

<h1>Welcome to the Tweets app</h2>

## It is difficult to describe what functionality it provides to the user, let's better tell you what basic technologies I used to create it:

- **react** - main
- **styled-components** - for styling
- **axios** - to make HTTP requests to the server and get data
- **react-router-dom** - for navigation
- **local-storage** - to store some data locally
